Whether it be a miniscule mollusc, an IMAX-sized Bowie, a water spirit or a honey-slathered Steve-O, the Letterboxd community has stared into the everything bagel and come out refreshed and awakened to new possibilities in cinema.

The highest-rated film in [the 2022 Year in Review](https://letterboxd.com/2022/) was the multiverse, sci-fi, family action-comedy [_Everything Everywhere All at Once_](https://boxd.it/jUk4), directed by Daniels Kwan and Scheinert, with M. Manikandan’s wholehearted Indian drama [_Kadaisi Vivasayi_](https://boxd.it/mGrm) and Dean Fleischer Camp’s stop-motion, live-action hybrid [_Marcel the Shell with Shoes On_](https://boxd.it/wMAk) rounding out the top three.

This trio of films couldn’t be more distinct from each other, yet each in its own way embraces situational absurdity to create a case for kindness—human-scale odes to life, flinging fanny-packs at our pandemic-related trauma.

_Everything Everywhere All at Once_ has dominated the Letterboxd fanbase since [its SXSW debut in March 2022](https://boxd.it/hnv) when early reviews indicated that the “[beautiful weirdos](https://boxd.it/2ECS1z)” had created something very special. Letterboxd members in those first weeks variously described the martial arts laundromat tax comedy as “a magic trick”, “life-changing”, “a delightful and strange surprise”, “a modern classic”, “one of the most fascinating movies of the decade” and “a joyous mess”.

“We would like to thank recency bias,” the Daniels told us back when _EEAaO_ briefly held the No. 1 spot of all time, threatening to flood the platform with one-star reviews to cool off the buzz. Un/fortunately for them, at no point in the past year did another film manage to overtake _EEAaO_ as the highest rated film of 2022.

Cate Blanchett did, however, overtake Zendaya as the most watched actress in 2022, thanks to her work in _TÁR_, _Guillermo del Toro’s Pinocchio_ and the late 2021 releases of _Don’t Look Up_ and _Nightmare Alley_, which most people caught in early ’22. _Nightmare Alley_ also helped Willem Dafoe retain his most watched actor crown for the second year in a row, along with _The Northman_, _Spider-Man: No Way Home_ and pretty much every other film in his huge resumé.

_The Batman_ director Matt Reeves makes his debut as most watched director courtesy of our avenging bat pal stepping out of the shadows with a new face—that of Robert Pattinson. _The Batman_ began 2022 as the most anticipated film by Letterboxd members, and ended the year as both the most popular film and the most obsessively rewatched film.

On the documentary front, our old pals Johnny Knoxville, Steve-O and friends were back and you loved their shenanigans so much, _Jackass Forever_ became the most popular documentary of the year, while the fur-coated fab four helped Peter Jackson take the highest rated documentary trophy.

There was so much more in 2022, as we tentatively returned to cinemas and doubled-down on home streaming and physical media. We looked to the clouds where we saw flying tigers. We flew in hypersonic jets a little too close to the Aftersun, past burning superyachts and fiery volcanos. We met kids obsessed with outer space in Apollo 10½, Mars One, Armageddon Time and Moonage Daydream. We came across cats in boots, supersized red pandas and donkeys, donkeys, everywhere.
